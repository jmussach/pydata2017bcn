# Convolutional neural networks for audio processing: starting pack
This repository contains the workshop presented at the PyData 2017 conference in Barcelona. 

The goal of the workshop is to familiarise intermediate python users with deep learning for audio processing. 

In the first part, we introduce key concepts in deep learning, followed by a short introduction to audio processing.

In the second part of the workshop we introduce the data pre-processing steps (Jupyter notebook 'DataPreprocessing.ipynb') including audio file reading, feature computation and batch generation.

# Dependencies 
python 2.7
